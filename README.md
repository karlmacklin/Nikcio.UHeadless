This repository creates an easy setup solution for making Umbraco headless. It comes with a wide range of extensibility options that can be tailored to your needs.

To get started, add the following to your `Startup.cs`.

## Setup

```CSharp
using Nikcio.UHeadless.Extensions;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
                /* Code obmitted for clarity */
                .AddUHeadless()
                /* Code obmitted for clarity */
        }

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    /* Code obmitted for clarity */

    app.UseUHeadlessGraphQLEndpoint();

    app.UseUmbraco()
    /* etc... */
}
```
Now your content will be avalible at `/graphql`

To get started try adding some content to the root and run the following query:
```graphql
{
  contentAtRoot {
    nodes {
      id,
      name
    }
  }
}
```
